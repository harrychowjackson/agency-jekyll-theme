description: As part of my contract with USRA, working for the Airbornce Science division of NASA, I accompanied a team to support our instrument, a spectrometer called <a href="https://mas.arc.nasa.gov/">eMAS</a>, a camera for several non-visible wavelengths. The sensors on this instrument need to be kept at very specific conditions to operate, even while exposed to the air on a plane flying at twice the height of a commercial airliner. Since it's technically taxpayer-funded, the data it collects is publically available to inform any earth science research that can use it. </br>The image above is a wildfire in Arizona, from August 2019.
