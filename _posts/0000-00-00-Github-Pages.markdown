description: "When I was looking for work during the quarrantine period, no job-callback fish were biting the job-searching lines I cast out. So, I decided to make my bait more attractive. I saw three options for making a personal portfolio website: use some site builder tool or blogging service, find a template that looked good and edit it to my own needs, or buy a domain and build one from scratch. I settled on the middle option After hearing github allots one free personal site to each account. If I could learn how to write it, I would never have to worry about my host going down. 

This static website you are looking at was generated using Jekyll from a template source I heavily edited. In the process, I learned a bit of HTML, Markdown, and CSS...and a lot about git commands."
