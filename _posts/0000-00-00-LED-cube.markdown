description: I tried for a long time to build a LED cube from scratch, but a kit was more cost effective. In order to drive such a huge number of pins with a reasonal number of microcontroller IOs, the LED states are written row by row into flip-flop latches, and only one layer is lit at a time. This happens quickly enough, however, that the entire cube can appear lit and animated, refreshing at 20+ Hz.
